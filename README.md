# DataCamp Data Analyst Associate Certificate
This repository is about the case study that I had to solve to get the DataCamp's Data Analyst Associate certification [here](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DAA0010376963011)

## Background

Vivendo is a fast food chain in Brazil with over 200 outlets. As with many fast food establishments, customers make claims against the company. For example, they blame Vivendo for suspected food poisoning. The legal team, who processes these claims, is currently split across four locations. The new head of the legal department wants to see if there are differences in the time it takes to close claims across the locations.

## User's Questions 
The legal team has given you a data set where each row is a claim made against the company. They would like you to answer the following questions:

● How does the number of claims differ across locations?

● What is the distribution of time to close claims?

● How does the average time to close claims differ by location?

## Insight and Recommendation

**Insight :**
- Sao Luis has the most number of claims with 30 claims, while Natal has the lowest of number of claims with 21 claims.
- The most distributions of time to close claims belongs in the range 250-750 days, with median 638 days. 
- The minimum time to close the claims is 29 days and the maximum time to close the claims is 3591 days
- Comparing the four locations, SAO LUIS processed the most time to close claims on average and NATAL has the fewest time.
- Natal has the most indivuals on claims with 168 people, while Fortaleza has the lowest individual on claims with 69 people.Furthermore,due to the large number of people claiming, the amount to be paid also increases. Natal has the most claim amount with R$ 4.045.193

**Recommendation:**

The legal team can conduct checks at various locations regarding the people who reported this incident. The priority locations to be checked are :
- Sao Luis : Need to check out this location because it processed the most time to close the claims among other locations.
- Natal : Although Natal has the fewest time to processed the claims, but the number of individual who claims this incident is the largest among other location. Natal also has the most claim amount and amount paid among other locations.
